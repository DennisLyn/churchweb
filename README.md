# churchweb
This repo keeps all independent works (outside of the WordPress works) for our church's website - [Chinese For Christ Church of Hayward](https://www.cfcchayward.org/). 

The website is built by WordPress, MySql and hosted on AWS.
(Note: WordPress code is not pushed here but backed up on AWS.)

Independent works: 
1. An Entry page for two websites (Chinese and English sites)
2. Sermon pages for administrators to create, add, edit, upload, and delete sermon info and videos.

# Folders

2. **[SermonListPage](https://github.com/DennisLyn/churchweb/tree/main/SermonListPage):** frontend + backend works: PHP, CSS, JS and data (cvs or xlsx) files.
